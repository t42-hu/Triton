# Triton42

Universal web, iOS, and Android application in `frontend/universal`, hosted by
the NextStack Next.js frontend with its NestJS backend. Start with
[the migration guide](docs/TRITON42_MIGRATION.md) and
[the application guide](docs/TRITON42_APP.md).

# Fullstack Starter

A cloneable TypeScript foundation: Next.js, NestJS, PostgreSQL/Drizzle, Better
Auth, Redis/BullMQ, Docker, and optional provider integrations.

```bash
./start.sh
```

The initializer creates a private `.env`, unique secrets and clone identity,
selects free local ports, and preserves existing configuration. Docker starts the
core services, runs serialized migrations, and starts the applications. The
usual application URL is <http://localhost:8080>; setup prints the actual URL.
`./start.sh` also enables the System Stats agent and opens its account-pairing
page. The agent requires a separate System Stats account and Docker-socket access.

- Email/password accounts, configurable social login, profile editing and uploads
- Local Mailpit email and SeaweedFS S3 storage without cloud credentials
- Optional SES, R2/S3, Stripe, Turnstile, Meilisearch, and ClamAV
- Clone-specific containers, data volumes, and authentication cookies
- Feature-aware UI, shared validated contracts, CORS/origin configuration
- Signed Stripe webhooks, transactional deduplication and a payment ledger
- Retry/retention defaults for background jobs and explicit worker failures
- Correlated redacted JSON logs, stable client errors, and optional OpenTelemetry
- System Stats host/container monitoring agent via `start.sh` (separate cloud account)
- Controlled migrations and backup/restore commands
- Pinned container digests, root lint/type/format checks, and GHCR release workflow
- Isolated integration and Playwright browser tests with CI reports and cleanup
- Automatic optional Cloudflare tunnel/DNS provisioning

Keep product code in `frontend/src`, `backend/src`, and `shared/src`.
Environment settings choose deployment/integrations; provider account setup and
product-specific rules still belong to each product.

```bash
pnpm verify
pnpm audit --audit-level high
pnpm project:doctor
pnpm dev:rebuild
pnpm dev:down

[Native foundation](./docs/NATIVE.md) provides a static bundle and native session/
callback contracts for [Electron desktop](./docs/ELECTRON.md). The separate
[Expo app](./docs/EXPO.md) provides a React Native starting point for iOS,
Android, and web with the same backend account system.
